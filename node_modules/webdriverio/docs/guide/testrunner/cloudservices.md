title: WebdriverIO - Using Cloud Services
---

# Using Cloud Services

Using cloud services with WebdriverIO is pretty simple.


1. Make sure WebdriverIO uses this host for as the selenium server, either
   by setting the `host` config or letting WebdriverIO configure that
   automatically based on the valued of `user` and `key`
2. (optional) set service specific values for each browser in
   `desiredCapabilities`.
3. (optional) tunnel local traffic to provider, so that your tests can access
   `localhost`

If you only want to run cloud services in Travis, you can use the `CI`
environment variable to check if you are in Travis and modify the config
accordingly.

```javascript
// wdio.conf.js

var config = {...}
if (process.env.CI) {
    config.capabilities = [{
        browserName: 'chrome'
    }]
}
exports.config = config
```

## [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/)

It is easy to set up your tests to run remotely in Sauce Labs.

The only requirement is to set the `user` and `key` in your config (either
exported by `wdio.conf.js` or passed into `webdriverio.remote(...)`) to your
Sauce Labs username and access key.

You can also pass in any optional [test configuration option](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/test-configuration/#webdriver-api)
as a key/value in the capabilities for any browser.

### [Sauce Connect](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/)

If you want to run tests against a server that is not accessible to the
Internet (like on `localhost`), then you need to use Sauce Connect.

It is out of the scope of WebdriverIO to support this, so you must start it by
yourself.

**Note:** Some people have reported trouble connecting to local websocket
connection over Sauce Connect. Websockets are officially supported with
Browserstack, however.

### With Travis CI

Travis CI, however, does
[have support](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/sauce-connect/#Setting-up-Sauce-Connect)
for starting Sauce Connect before each test, so follow their directions
for that if you are interested.

If you do so, you must set the `tunnel-identifier` test configuration option
in each browser's capabilities. Travis sets this to the `TRAVIS_JOB_NUMBER`
environmental variable by default.

Also if you want to have Sauce Labs group your tests by build number, you can
set the `build` to `TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER`.

If you set the `name`, this changes the name of this test in Sauce Labs for
this build.

Example `desiredCapabilities`:

```javascript
browserName: 'chrome',
version: '27.0',
platform: 'XP',
'tunnel-identifier': process.env.TRAVIS_JOB_NUMBER,
name: 'integration',
build: process.env.TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER
```

### Timeouts

Since you are running your tests remotely, it might be necessary to increase
some timeouts.

You can change the [idle timeout](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/test-configuration/#idle-test-timeout)
by passing `idle-timeout` as a test configuration option. This controls
how long Sauce will wait between commands before closing the connection.


## [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/)

Browserstack is also supported easily.

The only requirement is to set the `user` and `key` in your config (either
exported by `wdio.conf.js` or passed into `webdriverio.remote(...)`) to your
Browserstack automate username and access key.

You can also pass in any optional [supported capabilites](https://www.browserstack.com/automate/capabilities)
as a key/value in the capabilities for any browser. If you set `browserstack.debug`
to `true` it will record a screencast of the session, which might be helpful.

### [Local Testing](https://www.browserstack.com/local-testing#command-line)

If you want to run tests against a server that is not accessible to the
Internet (like on `localhost`), then you need to use Local Testing.
Browserstack does support websockets for local testing.

It is out of the scope of WebdriverIO to support this, so you must start it by
yourself.

If you do use local, you should set `browserstack.local` to `true` in your
capabilities.

### With Travis CI

If you want to add Local Testing in Travis you have to start it by yourself.

The following script will download and start it in the background.
You should run this in Travis before starting the tests.

```bash
wget https://www.browserstack.com/browserstack-local/BrowserStackLocal-linux-x64.zip
unzip BrowserStackLocal-linux-x64.zip
./BrowserStackLocal -v -onlyAutomate -forcelocal $BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY &
sleep 3
```

Also, you might wanna set the `build` to the Travis build number.

Example `desiredCapabilities`:

```javascript
browserName: 'chrome',
project: 'myApp',
version: '44.0',
build: 'myApp #' + process.env.TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER + '.' + process.env.TRAVIS_JOB_NUMBER,
'browserstack.local': 'true',
'browserstack.debug': 'true'
```

## [TestingBot](https://testingbot.com/)

The only requirement is to set the `user` and `key` in your config (either
exported by `wdio.conf.js` or passed into `webdriverio.remote(...)`) to your
TestingBot username and secret key.

You can also pass in any optional [supported capabilites](https://testingbot.com/support/other/test-options)
as a key/value in the capabilities for any browser.

### [Local Testing](https://testingbot.com/support/other/tunnel)

If you want to run tests against a server that is not accessible to the
Internet (like on `localhost`), then you need to use Local Testing.
TestingBot provides a JAVA based tunnel to allow you to test websites not accessible from the internet.

Their tunnel support page contains the information necessary to get this up and running.
