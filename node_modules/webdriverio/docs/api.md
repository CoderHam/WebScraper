# WebdriverIO API Docs

Welcome to the WebdriverIO docs page. These pages contain reference materials for all implemented selenium
bindings and commands. Since `v2.0.0` WebdriverIO has all [JSONWire protocol](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol)
commands implemented and also supports special bindings for [Appium](http://appium.io).
